\section{Coding Guidelines}
\label{sc_guidelines}
Writing code in a readable manner is very important, especially
for future code developers (e.g. for adding features, debugging, etc.).
This section is inspired by the DUNE coding guidelines
\url{http://www.dune-project.org/doc/devel/codingstyle.html}, which is strongly
recommended.

\paragraph{Documentation:}
Please document freely what each part of your code does. All comments/ documentation
is in \textbf{English}.
We proclaim the Doc-Me Dogma, which means whatever you do, please document
it least with
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxCode]
  /*! \todo Please doc me! */
\end{lstlisting}
That way at least the absence of documentation is documented, and it is easier
to get rid of it systematically. Please comment \textbf{all}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Method Parameters (in / out)
  \item Method parameters which are not self-explanatory should always
        have a meaningful comment at calling sites. Example:
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxCode]
    localResidual.eval(/*includeBoundaries=*/true);
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item Template Parameters
  \item Return Values
  \item Exceptions thrown by a method
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Naming:}
To avoid duplicated types or variables and for a better understanding and usability
of the code we have the following naming conventions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Variables/Functions \ldots}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item start in \emph{lower} case and contain letters.
  \item \emph{CamelCase}: if the name consists of  several words, then
        the first letter of a new word is capital.
  \item \emph{Self-Explaining}: in general abbreviations should be avoided (write saturation in stead of S)
  \item \emph{Abbreviations}: If and only if a single letter that represents an
         abbreviation or index is followed by a single letter (abbreviation or index),
         CamelCase is {\bf not} used. An inner-word underscore is only permitted if
         it symbolizes a fraction line. Afterwards, we continue with lower case, i.e.
         the common rules apply to both enumerator and denominator. Examples:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{pw} but \texttt{pressureW} $\rightarrow$ because ``pressure'' is a word.
      \item \texttt{srnw} but \texttt{sReg} $\rightarrow$ because ``reg'' is not an
            abbreviation of a single letter. ``n'' abbreviates ``non'',
             ``w'' is ``wetting'', so not CamelCase.
      \item \texttt{pcgw} but \texttt{dTauDPi} $\rightarrow$ Both ``Tau'' and ``Pi''
            are words, plus longer than a letter.
      \item \textbf{But:} \texttt{CaCO3} The only exception: chemical formulas are
            written in their chemically correct way $\rightarrow$ \texttt{CaCO3}
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Private Data Variables:} Names of private data variables end with an
      underscore and are the only variables that contain underscores.
\item \textbf{Type names:} For type names, the same rules as for variables apply. The
      only difference is that the \emph{first letter is capital}.
\item \textbf{Files:} File names should consist of \emph{lower case} letters
      exclusively. Header files get the suffix \texttt{.hh}, implementation files the
      suffix \texttt{.cc}
\item \textbf{The Exclusive-Access Macro:} Every header file traditionally begins
      with the definition of a preprocessor constant that is used to make sure that
      each  header file is only included once. If your header file is called
      'myheaderfile.hh', this constant should be DUMUX\_MYHEADERFILE\_HH.
\item \textbf{Macros:} The use of preprocessor macros is strongly discouraged. If you
      have to use them for whatever reason, please use capital letters only.
\end{itemize}
