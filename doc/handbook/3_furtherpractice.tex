\section{Further Practice}
\label{tutorial-furtherpractice}

If there is a request for further practice, we refer here to the test problems, that
are already implemented in \Dumux. Several examples for coupled and decoupled models
can be found in the \texttt{test}-directory. An overview over the available tests
cases can be found on the class documentation \url{http://www.dumux.org/documentation.php}.
There you also find a \emph{feature-list} for the individual tests.

Another possibility to gain experience with \Dumux is the \texttt{dumux-lecture} module. It is devided according to
the lecture modules Multi-phase-Modelling (mm), Environmental Fluid Mechanics (efm) and Modelling of Hydrosystems (mhs). 
They contain several test cases designed to enhance the understanding of physical modelling. 
Different aspects of modelling multi-phase multi-component flow and transport processes are approached such as the 
choice of phases and components, the discretization and the reduction of a complex problem to the main physical 
processes. You can find for example a comparison of different 2-phase-flow problems considering simply two immiscible 
fluids up to the case of components present in both phases. Most of the problems are oriented at current research topics.
All the scenarios and their physical background are explained in additional .tex-files. The following test cases are 
contained:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Buckley-Leverett Problem}
\item \texttt{$\text{CO}_2$-plume}
\item \texttt{Column Xylene}
\item \texttt{Convective Mixing}
\item \texttt{Fuel Cell}
\item \texttt{Heatpipe}
\item \texttt{Heavy Oil}
\item \texttt{Henry Problem}
\item \texttt{McWorther Problem}
\item \texttt{NAPL Infiltration}
\item \texttt{Remediation Scenarios}
\item \texttt{Groundwater}
\item \texttt{different 2-phase n-component problems}
\end{itemize}

Dumux-lecture can be obtained as follows:
