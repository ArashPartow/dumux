This model implements three-\/phase flow of three fluid phases $\alpha \in \{ water, gas, NAPL \}$ The standard multiphase Darcy approach is used as the equation for the conservation of momentum.

By inserting this into the equations for the conservation of the components, the well-\/known multiphase flow equation is obtained.

All equations are discretized using a vertex-\/centered finite volume (box) or cell-\/centered finite volume scheme as spatial and the implicit Euler method as time discretization.

The model uses commonly applied auxiliary conditions like $S_w + S_n + S_g = 1$ for the saturations. Furthermore, the phase pressures are related to each other via capillary pressures between the fluid phases, which are functions of the saturation, e.\-g. according to the approach of Parker et al.

The used primary variables are gas phase pressure $p_g$, water saturation $S_w$ and N\-A\-P\-L saturation $S_n$.
