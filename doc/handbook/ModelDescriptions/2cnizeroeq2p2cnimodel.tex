This model implements the same coupling conditions as the model
concepts, which couples Darcy and Stokes flow presented \hyperref[sc_2cnistokes2p2cni]{above}.
The only difference is that the eddy coefficients $\mu_\textrm{g,t}$,
$D_\textrm{g,t}$, and $\lambda_\textrm{g,t}$ are not necessarily non-zero
at the coupling interface.
