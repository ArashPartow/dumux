This model implements the same coupling conditions as the model
concepts, which couples Darcy and Stokes flow presented \hyperref[sc_2cstokes2p2c]{above}.
The only difference is that the eddy coefficients $\mu_\textrm{g,t}$
and $D_\textrm{g,t}$ are not necessarily non-zero at the coupling
interface.
