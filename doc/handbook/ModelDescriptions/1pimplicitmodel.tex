Single-\/phase, isothermal flow model, which uses a standard Darcy approach as the equation for the conservation of momentum\-: \[ v = - \frac{\textbf K}{\mu} \left(\textbf{grad}\, p - \varrho {\textbf g} \right) \]

and solves the mass continuity equation\-: \[ \phi \frac{\partial \varrho}{\partial t} + \text{div} \left\lbrace - \varrho \frac{\textbf K}{\mu} \left( \textbf{grad}\, p -\varrho {\textbf g} \right) \right\rbrace = q, \] All equations are discretized using a vertex-\/centered finite volume (box) or cell-\/centered finite volume scheme as spatial and the implicit Euler method as time discretization. The model supports compressible as well as incompressible fluids.
