\section{Restart \Dumux Simulations}
\label{sc_restartsimulations}

You can restart the simulation
from a specific point in time or extend the simulation beyond the originally
end of simulation. What you need is a \texttt{*.drs} file (which contains the
all necessary restart information.
Then you can simply restart a simulation via
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Bash]
./test_program -TimeManager.Restart RESTART_TIME
\end{lstlisting}
To test restart behavior, use the \texttt{test\_box1p2cni} problem
in the \texttt{test/implicit/1p2c} folder.
You get the \texttt{RESTART\_TIME} from the name of your \texttt{.drs} file.
Restarting will only work when the exact time from an existing restart file is given.
If you need more restart files, you can change the frequency
by including the function into your problem:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=DumuxCode]
// Writes a restart file every 5th time step
bool shouldWriteRestartFile() const
{
  return (this->timeManager().timeStepIndex() % 5 == 0);
}
\end{lstlisting}
