What is DUMUX?
==============

DuMuX [0] is a simulation toolbox mainly aimed at flow and transport
processes in porous media. DuMuX is build on top of the DUNE [1]
framework and aims to provide a multitude of numerical models as well
as flexible discretization methods for complex non-linear phenomena,
such as CO2 sequestration, soil remediation, drug delivery in cancer
therapy and more. Multi-scale and multi-physics methods are currently
actively worked on. See [2] for a more detailed description of the
goals and motivations behind DuMuX.
