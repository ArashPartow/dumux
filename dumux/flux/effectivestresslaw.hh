 * \brief Effective stress are used to describe the actual stresses acting on the grains/matrix in the soil.
 * Furthermore, they determine the behaviour of the soil.
 * Most of the geomechanical laws are written in terms of effective stresses,
 * such as the poroelastic model in dumux/geomechanics/poroelastic/model.hh
 *
 * Effective stresses are denoted with \f$ \boldsymbol{\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}} \f$.
 * The effective stress tensor \f$ \boldsymbol{\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}} \f$ is
 * determined by the stress tensor \f$ \boldsymbol{\sigma} \f$ , the effective pore pressure \f$ p_{\mathrm{eff}} \f$ and the Biot's coefficient \f$ \alpha \f$ :
 * \f[
 * \boldsymbol{\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}} = \boldsymbol{\sigma} - \alpha p_{\mathrm{eff}} \mathbf{I}
 * \f]
 * \note The implementations of the effective stress laws are inside the folders of their respective discretization.
