 * \ingroup ThreePThreeCModel
 * \brief Adaption of the fully implicit scheme to the three-phase three-component
 *        flow model.
 *
 * This model implements three-phase three-component flow of three fluid phases
 * \f$\alpha \in \{ water, gas, NAPL \}\f$ each composed of up to three components
 * \f$\kappa \in \{ water, air, contaminant \}\f$. The standard multiphase Darcy
 * approach is used as the equation for the conservation of momentum:
 * \f[
 v_\alpha = - \frac{k_{r\alpha}}{\mu_\alpha} \mathbf{K}
 \left(\textbf{grad}\, p_\alpha - \varrho_{\alpha} \mbox{\bf g} \right)
 * \f]
 *
 * By inserting this into the equations for the conservation of the
 * components, one transport equation for each component is obtained as
 * \f{eqnarray*}
 && \phi \frac{\partial (\sum_\alpha \varrho_{\alpha,mol} x_\alpha^\kappa
 S_\alpha )}{\partial t}
 - \sum\limits_\alpha \text{div} \left\{ \frac{k_{r\alpha}}{\mu_\alpha}
 \varrho_{\alpha,mol} x_\alpha^\kappa \mathbf{K}
 (\textbf{grad}\, p_\alpha - \varrho_{\alpha,mass} \mbox{\bf g}) \right\}
 \nonumber \\
 \nonumber \\
 && - \sum\limits_\alpha \text{div} \left\{ D_\text{pm}^\kappa \varrho_{\alpha,mol}
 \textbf{grad} x^\kappa_{\alpha} \right\}
 - q^\kappa = 0 \qquad \forall \kappa , \; \forall \alpha
 \f}
 *
 * Note that these balance equations are molar.
 *
 * All equations are discretized using a vertex-centered finite volume (box)
 * or cell-centered finite volume scheme as spatial
 * and the implicit Euler method as time discretization.
 *
 * The model uses commonly applied auxiliary conditions like
 * \f$S_w + S_n + S_g = 1\f$ for the saturations and
 * \f$x^w_\alpha + x^a_\alpha + x^c_\alpha = 1\f$ for the mole fractions.
 * Furthermore, the phase pressures are related to each other via
 * capillary pressures between the fluid phases, which are functions of
 * the saturation, e.g. according to the approach of Parker et al.
 *
 * The used primary variables are dependent on the locally present fluid phases.
 * An adaptive primary variable switch is included. The phase state is stored for all nodes
 * of the system. The following cases can be distinguished:
 * <ul>
 *  <li> All three phases are present: Primary variables are two saturations \f$(S_w\f$ and \f$S_n)\f$,
 *       and a pressure, in this case \f$p_g\f$. </li>
 *  <li> Only the water phase is present: Primary variables are now the mole fractions of air and
 *       contaminant in the water phase \f$(x_w^a\f$ and \f$x_w^c)\f$, as well as the gas pressure, which is,
 *       of course, in a case where only the water phase is present, just the same as the water pressure. </li>
 *  <li> Gas and NAPL phases are present: Primary variables \f$(S_n\f$, \f$x_g^w\f$, \f$p_g)\f$. </li>
 *  <li> Water and NAPL phases are present: Primary variables \f$(S_n\f$, \f$x_w^a\f$, \f$p_g)\f$. </li>
 *  <li> Only gas phase is present: Primary variables \f$(x_g^w\f$, \f$x_g^c\f$, \f$p_g)\f$. </li>
 *  <li> Water and gas phases are present: Primary variables \f$(S_w\f$, \f$x_w^g\f$, \f$p_g)\f$. </li>
 * </ul>
