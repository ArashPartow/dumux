 * \brief A single-phase, isothermal flow model using the fully implicit scheme.
 *
 * Single-phase, isothermal flow model, which uses a standard Darcy approach as the
 * equation for the conservation of momentum:
 * \f[
 v = - \frac{\textbf K}{\mu}
 \left(\textbf{grad}\, p - \varrho {\textbf g} \right)
 * \f]
 *
 * and solves the mass continuity equation:
 * \f[
 \phi \frac{\partial \varrho}{\partial t} + \text{div} \left\lbrace
 - \varrho \frac{\textbf K}{\mu} \left( \textbf{grad}\, p -\varrho {\textbf g} \right) \right\rbrace = q,
 * \f]
 * All equations are discretized using a vertex-centered finite volume (box)
 * or cell-centered finite volume scheme as spatial
 * and the implicit Euler method as time discretization.
 * The model supports compressible as well as incompressible fluids.
