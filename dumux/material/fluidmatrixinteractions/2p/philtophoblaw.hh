 *
 * \brief This material law takes a material law defined for effective
 *        saturations and converts it to a material law defined on absolute
 *        saturations.
 *
 *        Additionally, this class converts the material law defined for the wetting phase so that it
 *        can be called with the non-wetting phase saturation. This is needed for hydrophobic materials.
 *
 *        The idea: "material laws" (like VanGenuchten or BrooksCorey) are defined for effective saturations.
 *        The numeric calculations however are performed with absolute saturations. The EffToAbsLaw class gets
 *        the "material laws" actually used as well as the corresponding parameter container as template arguments.
 *
 *        The desired function (pc, Sw... ) of the actually used "material laws" gets the non-wetting
 *        saturation from the model. Here, the wetting saturation is calculated from it: \f$\mathrm{S_w = 1 - S_n}\f$.
 *        Then the effective wetting saturations are calculated and handed to the material law.
 *
 *        The following definition shows the pc-Sw-relationship for the case in which the x-axis 
 *        is \f$\mathrm{S_w (=S_{water})}\f$ and the y-axis is \f$\mathrm{p_c = p_{non_wetting}-p_{wetting}}\f$.
 *        \image html pc_Sw_1.png
 *
 *        But DumuX actually uses the following curve, because \f$\mathrm{p_c = p_{non-water}-p_{water}}\f$ for the y-axis is used.
 *        \image html pc_Sw_2.png
 *
 *        This approach makes sure that in the "material laws" only effective wetting saturations are considered, 
 *        which makes sense, as these laws only deal with effective saturations. This also allows for changing 
 *        the calculation of the effective saturations easily, as this is subject of discussion / may be problem specific.
 *
 *        Additionally, handing over effective saturations to the "material laws" in stead of them calculating effective
 *        saturations prevents accidentally "converting twice".
 *
 *        Additionally, the values calculated by the actual material laws are then modified: \f$\mathrm{pc_{phob} = - pc_{phil} (1-S_n)}\f$.
 *
 *        This boils down to:
 *        - the actual material laws (linear, VanGenuchten...) do not need to deal with any kind of conversion
 *        - the definition of the material law in the spatial parameters is not really intuitive, but using it is:
 *          Hand in values, get back values, do not deal with conversion.
 *
 *        CAREFULL: here w and n still stand for wetting and non-wetting. In the hydrophobic model w stands for 
 *        water (non-wetting) and n for non-water (wetting). Hence, Swr is the wetting phase (gas) residual 
 *        saturation and needs to be set accordingly in the spatial parameters.
