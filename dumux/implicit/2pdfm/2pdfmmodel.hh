 * \ingroup TwoPDFMBoxModel
 * \brief A two-phase, isothermal flow model using the fully implicit scheme.
 *
 * This model implements two-phase flow of two immiscible fluids
 * \f$\alpha \in \{ w, n \}\f$ using a standard multiphase Darcy
 * approach as the equation for the conservation of momentum, i.e.
 \f[
 v_\alpha = - \frac{k_{r\alpha}}{\mu_\alpha} \textbf{K}
 \left(\textbf{grad}\, p_\alpha - \varrho_{\alpha} {\textbf g} \right)
 \f]
 *
 * By inserting this into the equation for the conservation of the
 * phase mass, one gets
 \f[
 \phi \frac{\partial \varrho_\alpha S_\alpha}{\partial t}
 -
 \text{div} \left\{
 \varrho_\alpha \frac{k_{r\alpha}}{\mu_\alpha} \mbox{\bf K} \left(\textbf{grad}\, p_\alpha - \varrho_{\alpha} \mbox{\bf g} \right)
 \right\} - q_\alpha = 0 \;,
 \f]
 *
 * These equations are discretized by a fully-coupled vertex centered finite volume
 * (box) scheme as spatial and the implicit Euler method as time
 * discretization.
 *
 * By using constitutive relations for the capillary pressure \f$p_c =
 * p_n - p_w\f$ and relative permeability \f$k_{r\alpha}\f$ and taking
 * advantage of the fact that \f$S_w + S_n = 1\f$, the number of
 * unknowns can be reduced to two. Currently the model supports
 * choosing either \f$p_w\f$ and \f$S_n\f$ or \f$p_n\f$ and \f$S_w\f$
 * as primary variables. The formulation which ought to be used can be
 * specified by setting the <tt>Formulation</tt> property to either
 * <tt>TwoPCommonIndices::pWsN</tt> or <tt>TwoPCommonIndices::pNsW</tt>. By
 * default, the model uses \f$p_w\f$ and \f$S_n\f$.
