- In order to use the AMGBackend, you have to apply the patch 
  pdelab-1.0.1.patch in your directory containing DUNE-PDELab 1.0.1, e.g.:
  patch -p0 <../dumux/patches/pdelab-1.0.1.patch

- If the AMGBackend should be used without SuperLU as coarse grid solver, it can
  be benefitial to decrease the corresponding tolerance. To do so, apply the
  patch istl-2.2.0.patch in your directory containing DUNE-ISTL 2.2, e.g.:
  patch -p0 <../dumux/patches/istl-2.2.0.patch
