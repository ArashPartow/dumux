- If the AMGBackend should be used without SuperLU as coarse grid solver, it can
  be benefitial to decrease the corresponding tolerance. To do so, apply the
  patch istl-2.4.1.patch in your directory containing
  dune-istl 2.4.1, e.g.:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/istl-2.4.1.patch

- If dune-cornerpoint has to be used for, e.g., employing the CpGridCreator,
  and Opm is compiled from source, it might be necessary to patch opm-parser:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/opm-parser-2015.10.patch
  In addition, it might be necessary to set manually some CMake variables in the
  CMAKE_FLAGS section of the .opts-file:
    -Ddune-cornerpoint_PREFIX=/path/to/dune-cornerpoint \
    -Dopm-common_PREFIX=/path/to/opm-common \
    -Dopm-core_PREFIX=/path/to/opm-core \
    -Dopm-material_PREFIX=/path/to/opm-material \
    -Dopm-parser_PREFIX=/path/to/opm-parser \
    -DHAVE_DUNE_CORNERPOINT=1 \
  Currently, Dumux is supposed to be compatible with the Opm 2015.10 release.
