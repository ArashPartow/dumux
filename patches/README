- If you want to run a Dumux multidomain model with Dune 2.4, the module
  dune-multidomaingrid has to be patched: apply multidomaingrid-2.3.patch in the
  directory containing the releases/2.3-branch of dune-multidomaingrid, e.g.:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/multidomaingrid-2.3.patch

- If the AMGBackend should be used without SuperLU as coarse grid solver, it can
  be benefitial to decrease the corresponding tolerance. To do so, apply the
  patch istl-2.3.0.patch in your directory containing
  dune-istl 2.3.0, e.g.:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/istl-2.3.0.patch

- If UG has been installed for parallel usage, and you want to run a Dumux
  multidomain model, you have to patch dune-grid. The patch will introduce
  geometries for edges and faces in UG, which need to be present, otherwise the
  compiler will complain. Apply the patch grid-2.3.1.patch in your directory
  containing dune-grid 2.3.1 by, e.g.:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/grid-2.3.1.patch
  If you want to use Dune 2.4, the missing functionality is already included,
  so the patch is not needed.

- If dune-cornerpoint has to be used for, e.g., employing the CpGridCreator,
  a set of patches is needed for the build system. The patches have to be
  applied in the directories of the OPM modules:
  * opm-parser: patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/opm-parser-2015.04.patch
  * opm-core: patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/opm-core-2015.04.patch
  * dune-cornerpoint: patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/dune-cornerpoint-2015.04.patch
  In addition to applying the patches, it is necessary to set manually some
  CMake variables in the CMAKE_FLAGS section of the .opts-file:
    -Ddune-cornerpoint_PREFIX=/path/to/dune-cornerpoint \
    -Dopm-core_PREFIX=/path/to/opm-core \
    -Dopm-parser_PREFIX=/path/to/opm-parser \
    -DHAVE_DUNE_CORNERPOINT=1 \
