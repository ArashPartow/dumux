- If the AMGBackend should be used without SuperLU as coarse grid solver, it can
  be benefitial to decrease the corresponding tolerance. To do so, apply the
  patch istl-2.4.1.patch in your directory containing
  dune-istl 2.4.1, e.g.:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/istl-2.4.1.patch

- If opm-grid has to be used for, e.g., employing the CpGridCreator,
  and Opm is compiled from source, it is necessary to patch opm-common and
  opm-grid, namely, to execute in the corresponding folders:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/opm-common-2018.04.patch
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/opm-grid-2018.04.patch
  Currently, Dumux is supposed to be compatible with the Opm 2018.04 release.
