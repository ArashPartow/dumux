- If the AMGBackend should be used without SuperLU as coarse grid solver, it can
  be benefitial to decrease the corresponding tolerance. To do so, apply the
  patch istl-2.3.0.patch in your directory containing
  DUNE-ISTL 2.3.0, e.g.:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/istl-2.3.0.patch

- If UG has been installed for parallel usage, and you want to run a Dumux
  multidomain model, you have to patch dune-grid. The patch will introduce
  geometries for edges and faces in UG, which need to be present, otherwise the
  compiler will complain. Apply the patch grid-2.3.1.patch in your directory
  containing dune-grid 2.3.1 by, e.g.:
  patch -p1 <../dumux/patches/grid-2.3.1.patch
  If you want to use Dune 2.4, it is most likely that the missing functionality
  will be included in dune-grid by 10/2014, so the patch will not be needed.
