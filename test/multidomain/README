== Running the test cases in test/multidomain ==

You need the following releases of the DUNE core modules and 
dune-multidomain(grid):
Dune core modules: release 2.3
Dune-PDELab: release 2.0
dune-multidomaingrid: release branch 2.3
dune-multidomain: release branch 2.0
For your convenience we provide the Shell script installRequiredModules.sh
in the same folder as this README. Alternatively, you can use the script
checkout-dumux from dumux.org/download/.

Install the external grid manager UG and a direct linear solver like SuperLU
or PARDISO. You need Boost fusion for dune-multidomaingrid.

If UG is installed for parallel usage, dune-grid has to be patched. See the
patches directory for more information.

On some machines, some compilers with full optimization -O3 might produce
executables that yield segmentation faults (we encountered this behavior with
gcc-4.8). In this case, reduce the optimization level or try a different
compiler. If you still encounter segmentation faults, make sure that UG, all
DUNE libraries and the executable in question are built with the same compiler.
