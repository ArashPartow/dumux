== Running the test cases in test/multidomain ==

You need the following releases of the DUNE core modules and 
dune-multidomain(grid):
Dune core modules: release 2.3
Dune-PDELab: release 2.0
dune-multidomaingrid: release branch 2.3
dune-multidomain: release branch 2.0

Install the external grid manager UG. Additional you need to install a
direct linear solver like SuperLU or PARDISO.
You need Boost fusion for dune-multidomaingrid.

There are compiler restrictions:
- GCC 4.6 works.
- GCC 4.7 produces segmentation faults.
- GCC 4.8 and 4.9 works only with unoptimized builds (-O0).
- Clang is not supported.
- Intel ICC is not tested.

For your convenience we provide the Shell script installRequiredModules.sh
in the same folder as this README.
