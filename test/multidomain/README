== Running the test cases in test/multidomain ==

You need the following versions of the required Dune modules:
Dune core modules: 2.4
dune-typetree, dune-multidomaingrid: release (branch) 2.3
Dune-PDELab, dune-multidomain: release (branch) 2.0
dune-multidomaingrid has to be patched, see patches/README for details.

The necessary modules and the correct versions can be obtained by using
the script located in:
  bin/installexternal.sh

-- Other external packages --
Install the external grid manager UG and a direct linear solver like SuperLU
or UMFPACK. You need Boost fusion for dune-multidomaingrid.

If you encounter segmentation faults, make sure that UG, all DUNE libraries and
the executable in question are built with the same compiler.
