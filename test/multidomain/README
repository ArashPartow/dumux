== Running the test cases in test/multidomain ==

You need the following versions of the required Dune modules:
Dune core modules, dune-typetree, dune-multidomaingrid: release (branch) 2.3
Dune-PDELab, dune-multidomain: release (branch) 2.0

For your convenience we provide the Shell script installRequiredModules.sh
in the same folder as this README. Alternatively, you can use the script
checkout-dumux from dumux.org/download/.

Alternatively, you can use version 2.4 of the Dune core modules
(_not_ dune-typetree which stays at 2.3). In this case, you have to patch
dune-multidomaingrid. See the patches directory for more information.

Install the external grid manager UG and a direct linear solver like SuperLU
or PARDISO. You need Boost fusion for dune-multidomaingrid.

If UG is installed for parallel usage, dune-grid has to be patched. See the
patches directory for more information.

On some machines, some compilers with full optimization -O3 might produce
executables that yield segmentation faults (we encountered this behavior with
gcc-4.8). In this case, reduce the optimization level or try a different
compiler. If you still encounter segmentation faults, make sure that UG, all
DUNE libraries and the executable in question are built with the same compiler.
