# Tracer transport problem implementation

In the following, we will discuss the implementation of the tracer transport problem.
In particular, we will look at the necessary compile-time definitions in `properties_tracer.hh`,
the implementation of the initial and boundary conditions in `problem_tracer.hh` and the parameter
distributions in `spatialparams_tracer.hh`.
