# Single-phase flow problem implementation

In the following, we will discuss the implementation of the single-phase flow problem.
In particular, we will look at the necessary compile-time definitions in `properties_1p.hh`,
the implementation of the initial and boundary conditions in `problem_1p.hh` and the permeability
and porosity distributions in `spatialparams_1p.hh`.
